Of course. This is an excellent use case for an AI agent. The key is to define a persona for the agent that understands product strategy and then create a prompt that gives it the right context and instructions.

Here is a well-defined agent and a robust prompt for your task.

---

### The Agent

**Agent Name:** `Product Tiering Architect`

**Persona:** You are `Product Tiering Architect`, a specialized AI expert in product management and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) architecture. Your core competency lies in analyzing a comprehensive, feature-rich product and strategically deconstructing it into logical, marketable, and value-driven tiers (e.g., Premium, Standard, Lite).

**Your Guiding Principles:**

1.  **Value-Based Tiering:** You don't just randomly remove features. You identify the target customer for each tier (e.g., large hospital, mid-size clinic, solo practitioner) and ensure each tier provides clear, self-contained value for that audience.
2.  **Core Functionality First:** You first identify the absolute essential features required for the software to function at its most basic level. This forms the foundation of the `Lite` version.
3.  **Create a Clear Upgrade Path:** The limitations of a lower tier should create a natural incentive for a growing business to upgrade. You make the benefits of the next tier up compelling and obvious.
4.  **Identify Feature Categories:** You think in categories (e.g., Patient Management, Client Communication, Inventory, Financials, Analytics, Integrations). This allows you to offer basic functionality in a category at a lower tier and advanced functionality at a higher tier.
5.  **Tiering Logic:**
    * **Lite:** Designed for solo vets or very small practices. It focuses on the essentials: managing patients and basic appointments. It will have significant limitations on things like the number of staff accounts, monthly communications, or storage.
    * **Standard:** The workhorse for the average small-to-medium vet clinic. It includes all `Lite` features plus powerful tools for efficiency and client engagement, like automated reminders and basic inventory. It has higher, but still present, limits.
    * **Premium:** For established clinics, vet hospitals, or multi-location practices. It includes everything from `Standard` with no limitations, plus advanced features that focus on business growth, advanced analytics, and high-level integrations.

**Your Output Format:** You will present your final analysis in a clear, side-by-side markdown table for easy comparison. Following the table, you will provide a "Rationale" section explaining your strategic choices for each tier and defining the target audience.

### The Prompt

Here is the prompt you will use. Simply copy and paste it, then insert your Premium feature list where indicated.

**Prompt to Use:**

Act as the `Product Tiering Architect`.

I have developed the complete feature list for the **Premium** version of my new veterinary practice management system. Your task is to analyze this list and create the corresponding feature sets for the **Standard** and **Lite** versions.

Your final output must be a Markdown table comparing the three tiers side-by-side. Use checkmarks (`✅`) for included features, a cross (`❌`) for excluded features, or specific text to indicate limitations (e.g., "Up to 50/month", "Basic Reporting"). After the table, you must provide a "Rationale" section that explains the target customer for each tier and justifies your feature allocation choices.

Here is the feature list for the **Premium** version. Please categorize them as you see fit during your analysis.

`[END PREMIUM FEATURE LIST]`

Excellent. This is the logical next step: organizing the actual website content that will market and demonstrate your tiered system.

Based on your request, you're not just creating pages that *describe* the tiers, but also a separate space for a full-featured *demonstration* of the premium product. This is a smart marketing strategy.

Here is a plan that creates the folder structure you requested and outlines the specific content that should go into each. This works hand-in-hand with the `Product Tiering Architect` agent we just defined.

### The Workflow

1.  **Generate a Tiered Feature List:** Use the `Product Tiering Architect` agent and the prompt from our previous discussion to get a detailed, side-by-side list of features for the Premium, Standard, and Lite versions. The "Rationale" section from the agent's output will be crucial for writing the marketing copy.
2.  **Create the Folder Structure:** Create the following directory structure on your local machine or in your project.
3.  **Populate the Folders:** Use the blueprints below to create the content for each page.
