## Key Technical Considerations

### API Integration Points
```javascript
// Example: Creating a payment intent for vet consultation
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: consultationFee * 100, // Amount in cents
  currency: 'usd',
  customer: customerId,
  metadata: {
    pet_id: petId,
    appointment_id: appointmentId,
    service_type: 'consultation',
    clinic_id: clinicId
  },
  automatic_payment_methods: {
    enabled: true,
  },
  setup_future_usage: 'on_session' // Save for future use
});
```

### Webhook Events to Handle
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Confirm appointment
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Retry logic
- `customer.subscription.created` - Activate wellness plan
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Deactivate services
- `charge.refunded` - Update appointment status
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Send receipts

### Database Schema Considerations
```sql
-- Payment tracking table
CREATE TABLE payments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  stripe_payment_intent_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
  pet_id UUID REFERENCES pets(id),
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  status VARCHAR(50),
  service_type VARCHAR(100),
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Subscription tracking
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
  plan_type VARCHAR(100),
  status VARCHAR(50),
  current_period_start TIMESTAMP,
  current_period_end TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Critical Scenarios to Handle
1. **Double-charging Prevention**: Implement idempotency keys
2. **Network Timeouts**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
3. **Partial Refunds**: For cancelled services within packages
4. **Currency Conversion**: For international clinics
5. **Payment Method Failures**: Graceful fallback options
6. **Subscription Migrations**: Moving between plan tiers

### Customer Communication
- Clear payment confirmation emails
- Failed payment notifications with retry links
- Upcoming charge reminders for subscriptions
- Digital receipts with detailed breakdowns

## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Successful payment â†’ appointment confirmation
2. **Failed Payments**: Insufficient funds, expired cards
3. **Refund Flows**: Full and partial refunds
4. **Subscription Lifecycle**: Creation, updates, cancellation
5. **Edge Cases**: Network failures, webhook retries
6. **Load Testing**: High-volume transaction periods

### Stripe Test Cards
```
Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
